## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to guide users on how to report a vulnerability.

### Where to Report

You can report security vulnerabilities by [creating an issue](www.linkedin.com/in/joki-8b40a7244) in our GitHub repository.

### Response Time

We strive to acknowledge and respond to security vulnerability reports as quickly as possible. Expect an initial response within [timeframe].

### Vulnerability Management Process

Upon receiving a vulnerability report, we follow these steps:

1. **Evaluation**: We assess the reported vulnerability and its potential impact on the project.
2. **Mitigation**: If the vulnerability is confirmed, we work on a fix to resolve it.
3. **Release**: Once a fix is developed, we release patches for the supported versions.
4. **Disclosure**: We coordinate the disclosure of the vulnerability and the release of patches.

### Vulnerability Disclosure

We adhere to responsible disclosure practices. Once a vulnerability is confirmed and mitigated, we will provide credit to the reporter (if desired) and disclose the vulnerability along with the patched versions.

### What to Expect

- If the vulnerability is accepted: We will keep you informed about the progress and provide updates on the fix.
- If the vulnerability is declined: We will provide reasons for the decision and suggestions (if any) on how to address the issue.

### Feedback

We welcome feedback on our security policies and processes. If you have any suggestions or questions, please [contact us](link-to-contact-info).
